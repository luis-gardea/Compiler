The first bug fix that we made was changing the way the single comment "-- ......" works. Before, it was set to end whenever it encountered the \n newline character and not do anything, but now, because it has to encounter \n to end, we must also increment the line count.

Within a string, before \r would insert '\r' as a character to the string being returned, but it should actually count it as a regular character 'r', since '\r' was not within the special characters in strings.

Another issue was found in the line number of error messages inside of the string starting condition. We reported errors at the end of the string, on the line after but now, we are reporting the error when it first encounters it. This was the case with unenescaped \n and null-characters
